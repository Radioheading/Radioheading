### A brief introduction to me

ðŸ“šCurrently I'm a undergrad in ACMClass2022, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Starting in June, 2024, I am a research intern at Emerging Parallel Computer Center (EPCC Lab), co-advised by Prof. Jingwen Leng and Prof. Yu Feng. My research interest mainly lies in computer systems, especially in the field of creating efficient algorithms and hardware-software co-design for machine learning systems.

ðŸŒŠThe website mainly includes my implementations of the projects that I've conquered during the quest in ACMClass, as well as the antifacts that arise my personal interest.
